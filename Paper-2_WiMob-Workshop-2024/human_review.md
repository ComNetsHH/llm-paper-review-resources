-Clear abstract and goals -Introduction: You present an improvement of your SLF protocol of 2023 and obtain interesting results. Is a next step also a practical/experimental evaluation and validation? Then it could be work for a journal. Maybe mention as future work. -The forwarding area is well explained: this is specifically for 802.11p. Does this depend on the environment, please add in text? Urban/rural: more or less nodes can be present so dependency, and then the channel model is also relevant. -Also mention 5G-NR: this will be a next step and comparison with 802.11p, assessment of a_thr value for 5G-NR -Remove references in conclusions, normally this is not done for IEEE -sentence pp. 5 “The 90th percentile of the end-to-end is shown in Figure 9” add the word delay  “The 90th percentile of the end-to-end DELAY is shown in Figure 9” -pp. 4 “unique received packets” -> “uniqueLY received packets”; also line below for sent packets

The paper deals with urban UAV networks, in particular with provisioning an efficient protocol for a redundant control connection i.e. point-to-point communication between a UAV and its operator in the case when the proprietary primary connection breaks.

For this purpose, the authors propose a novel protocol named Spotlight Flooding (SLF) and its enhanced version -- SLF+. Both protocols are built on top of the RDF protocol which was recently proposed by the same authors for position sharing among UAVs. Both SLF and SLF+ are clearly described and derived. The authors present a number of numerical results obtained for the proposed protocols using the ns-3 simulator. The results are presented for two scenarios and the following parameters: Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), end-to-end delay of the control packets and traffic density (the latter is a measure of an load generated by the protocol). The results are thoroughly discussed.

No weaknesses of the paper were identified.

The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of UAV communication networks, specifically addressing the challenge of maintaining reliable point-to-point control connections in dense urban environments. The authors propose a novel communication protocol, Spotlight Flooding (SLF), and its enhanced version, SLF+, which builds on the existing Rate Decay Flooding (RDF) method for position sharing in UAV networks. This approach is particularly relevant given the increasing complexity of UAV traffic management in urban settings.

The paper is well-written and structured, with a clear explanation of the technical aspects of the proposed protocols. The authors provide a comprehensive evaluation of SLF and SLF+ through simulations, demonstrating that SLF+ can achieve a Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) above 90% in large networks with significant UAV traffic while maintaining low end-to-end delays. These results are compelling and suggest that the protocols are both effective and scalable.

In addition to its technical strengths, the paper has important practical implications. The proposed protocols address the critical need for a backup control connection in the event of a primary connection failure, which is essential for the safe and efficient operation of UAVs in densely populated urban areas. The authors' work is timely and highly relevant, making a strong case for the adoption of these protocols in real-world UAV networks.

While the paper is robust, there are minor areas that could be improved. A more detailed comparison with other existing protocols could provide additional context for the performance of SLF and SLF+. Additionally, a discussion on potential challenges in real-world implementation would further strengthen the paper. Overall, however, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field and should be accepted for presentation at the IEEE workshop.
